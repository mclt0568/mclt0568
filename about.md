# The Ultimate "About Me" of Frankie Zhao

**<u>READ THIS FIRST</u>**

Everything you see here is everything about me. Read anything that you are interested in, feel free to skip the one that's not relevant for you to understand who am I. There are not much "codes" or "programming languages I know" going on here, but there are lots of my true thoughts that I have concluded for myself. This is what I believe an "about me" should have. Hope this gets you to understand me a little more.

### IT/CS Related

This is a big part of my life, almost half of my life has been programming.

#### Why do I like Computer Stuff? My Introduction on Programming and Software Related

> It's enjoyable to see something, and you expect it to work, and it works

This all started first came to Malaysia when I had no friend due to the language barrier, and my parents are busy. This is when I had my parent's laptop as my friend.

Without an Internet connection, all I did (and I enjoined doing) was to explore the computer settings. From changing the wallpaper to setting up a new user account (I was still in Kindergarten).

> Exploration is fun, If you see a button that you don't know what it does, just click it and see what happens

It was still Windows XP when everything of the system which you can change is found in a folder called "Control Panel", I kind of clicked everything I can in that "Control Panel" and see what happens. I kind of developed a skill which allows me to predict what would happen when I click something.

> I understand how this works now! I think I can change it and make it looks just a little different from other people's

It seems that I have understood how windows work better than anyone else at my age that time, or even people at my parents' age, I was able to change the icon of different file type (File Type Association), How to customize my task-bar and my start menu to make it looks like Windows 2000. I have explored the C:\Windows directory and System32 Directory, and have a basic understanding of how the command line works in Windows.

> Wait, was that my first piece of code?

My first touch to "programming" was exploring Microsoft Access (I didn't know that was something called "database" at the time). In Microsoft Access, you can create forms to manage your data in a table, and create VB Functions that automate things. It was at the same time, I came across a tutorial of making a login form in VB. So I made my first login form by a simple If statement.

```vB
IF textbox1.text = "frankie" AND textbox2.text = "1234" THEN
  msgbox("Login Successed!")
ELSE
  msgbox("Login Failed!")
END IF
```

I didn't realize that this is programming until someone in the same school told me that this **is** programming and coding (Our school came with both Primary Section and Secondary Section)

> Some best times in my life

This was in primary school, when I still have plenty of time to explore this without worrying my Science Results or if I can write Chinese Words correctly.  I started to learn lots of fun programming things with the friend I made (the one told me that I write codes).

At this point, I'm just simply excited about coding. I would spend hours and hours to understand how something works and see if I can make a similar one just by myself.

This continues until now, but I kind of have a direction to work on now.

#### What I Have Done (or currently working on)

Here are projects I worked on (Personal projects). They are all based on my hobby, most of them are unfinished.

- **The Fr-sh Project** (Working on)

  Fr-sh is an interpretive shell and shell language for scripting for the Linux operating system. [Github Repo](https://www.github.com/mclt0568/fr-sh-remade)

  The main idea of Fr-sh is to improve the current Bash and Zsh Syntax. Ideas including:

  - Adding Data types to Variables

  - A Better way to access or pipe the stdio/ fileio and return code of processes
  - Improved syntax of special statements (such as If, While, For)
  - Supports Extension and Theme Developments (You can write extensions to this bash to customize it)
  - A set of organized, easy-to-use tool to manipulate string, makes it easy to use to write scripts automate file modifications
  - Support Error Handling and Exceptions when Scripting
  - Keeps key features of Bash so it's easy to use for people who are used to Bash and Zsh

- **A multi-purpose chat-bot for Discord** (Old project. Not on Github)

  Discord is a chatting app, and it has an API to create chat-bot that can listen to your message and respond to you

  The bot can:

  - Look up weather
    - It checks for keywords in your sentence such as "weather", "humidity", "temperature" and "what", "how", "check" etc
    - If it detects those keywords, it will search your sentence to Google and get the HTML for weather information
    - Then it will use reg-ex to filter out the necessary information and format it into a readable form, then send it to the chat of the app
  - Translation, Language Detection
  - Uses Google Translate Python API
  - Timer and Countdowns
    - checks for keywords like "count to", "countdown", "alarm" and extract the number, units such as "30 minute", "20 seconds"
    - count down and sends a message to remind you when its time up
  - Other things like math calculations
  - Calculate simple math by using `eval()` function in Python
  - Calculates Simultaneous Equation with a given `ax^2+bx=c`

- **The Discord-Chat-bot-Maker** (Temporarily discontinued)

  The DCPyBotter is a GUI application (Kind of like an IDE) for making Discord Chat-Bots. [Github Repo](https://www.github.com/mclt0568/DCPyBotter) 

  This is the only C# project I've written

- **Other Small Projects** (Mostly Discontinued, Maybe I should find some time to continue them)

  - **ColorStr** - A Python Library that allows you to print colored text on the terminal while code is easy to read. [Github Repo](https://www.github.com/mclt0568/ColorStr)
  - **Conway's Game of Life Simulator** - A python written program that simulates Conway's Game of Life. [Github Repo](https://github.com/mclt0568/Conway-s-Game-of-Life) 

#### What am I Interested in Next

- **Internet of Things** - If IOT can be standardized and work together

  If a protocol can be made and custom application can be made to control these

  - Every smart home appliances have a bar-code-like code that can be scanned and register to a phone app (or a server)
  - After pairing up to the server, the appliances can communicate with the server. Cross branding can be achieved

  - Developers can create their server that follows the same protocol

- **UI Design and UX Improvement**

  Due to poor UI design of Windows, see if there's a way to improve the windows touch experience while maintaining the experience of mouse users.


#### What do I Want to Learn and Expect Myself to Get Good In

- Learn how to work with people
- Learn to contribute to an open-source project to improve it

### Games and Things Games Taught Me

I'm not clear about the definition of a game. For me, anything fun can be game, any serious exploration in knowledge can be fun. I do things that are fun to me, therefore Programming can be games to me too.

But I'm just gonna talk about games of what most people define.

#### Why Do I Play Games 

> Things kids play

When I first joined the primary school, Minecraft was a big trend across my classmates, and of course, I'm part of the trend. 

Minecraft is a game which allows you to explore a world made out of blocks, you can build houses, destroy things, create new things, cook foods. It also has a very powerful extension system allows you to add additional content to the game (The mod system). This allows it can be anything. It can be scientific, it can be artistic, it can be *anything*.

> Truly "Play and Learn"

This provides me with a platform to create things that are in my mind, and I spend tons of time exploring the content of the game, learning the mechanism behind each element of the game. The technical and industrial add-on of the game is something I enjoy at the time, it adds things like more minerals and ores, machinery, the concept of electricity to the game. To play these game contents, you'll need to learn the electrical science or some chemistry of mineral production and alloying of this game, which is somewhat similar to the science in real-life.

> Things kids play ...?

Whenever there's an update to the game or something which I can't understand, Google comes in handy. Sometimes something wrong happened in the game was caused by a bug in the game, there will be tutorials to teach you how to debug the game, and fix them by changing some files. After doing this several of the time, I kind of understand how this game works in terms of the technical part. I started to modify the game's assets to change how things look or adding a custom Language to the game (such as making potatoes in the game to be called "strawberries" by changing the English Language File).

> Because It's Fun

Everything I do is to enjoy with this game, I wasn't playing this game because it's "educative", nor this game is created to "educate" people.

Just because it was fun for me to play and explore this game.

#### The Potential of Games in Education

> Why can we understand how the game works, why can we memorize the game content, but we have trouble learning math and chemistry?

After entering High school, I found out the concept of scientific theories that people struggle to understand and memorize is just the complicated version of "Minecraft", after realizing this, I was able to learn these science subjects a lot faster and had no problem understanding these concepts in a deeper level.

This kind of proves that there's no true difference from playing games than studying, sports, or anything else that we believes is to make us a better person. They both require the same skills and process, the skill to research online, the skill to understand and think logically, self-training to get better at a certain field, or even the skill to find the way to get better.

Therefore the real question is: 

> What makes "learning in school" so difficult for most people?

#### What *is* Education?

I don't see education is fully about learning knowledge and getting a good score.

When I was still in an early stage at school, I have often been told that going to school, learn things and score well is my duty as a student, and the reason behind doing all this is to get a good job and achieve a good life. As a kid who don't think about the meaning of words, or the reason behind it, I simply think that these repeating words are meaningless. I don't understand what's a good life, I'm not sure if I want it, but there was one thing that I know for sure -- I don't like being forced to do the same math questions every day. I was fed with this knowledge.

But on the other side, I enjoy playing games. I enjoy learning and understanding the game I'm playing. Therefore, I think exploration, try to enjoy something and learn something useful to enjoy what you want to enjoy is what education all about.
